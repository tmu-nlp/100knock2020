Brief Personal History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( The History of Japan ) , there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , saying , ' The Emperor is the mountain of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain , ' and it is said that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains .
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
It is an order to support the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a misunderstanding that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi and the Emperor Tenmu , who was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , was a son of Emperor Jomei , and it is based on the theory that the Emperor Tenchi was the older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that ' the father of his father was a younger brother of his father , ' however , there is a theory that says that ' the younger brother of his brother , who was a younger brother of his older brother , was said to be a younger brother , ' but it is said that the age of the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , and when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , he died in the age of 16 .
Therefore , the year of his birth year was in 614 , which was adopted by the Imperial Court in the same year .
" In the ancient times , there was not a rare case in the ancient times , " and it was not unusual in the ancient times , and it was not unusual for the Emperor Tenchi and Jito ( Empress Jito , who had already been enthroned in the era of Emperor Tenmu ) .
Therefore , there was a misunderstanding .
In addition , there is also a theory that the book is different from the fact that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was compiled in the era of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu age ' ) .
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was dismissed from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms of Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , this theory came to be seen in the description of the Taika Reforms .
In addition , the reason why the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication was banned by the Soga clan , who had not been expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication , and so on .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , describes that she was a wife of Emperor Kotoku who was a wife of Emperor Tenchi ( the younger maternal half-sister of Emperor Tenchi ) .
Although she was allowed to love love with her half-brothers , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to have a close relationship with his younger brothers , who was a younger sister of Chiko SANAKA , but he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Emperor Saimei , the Imperial Princess was succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor , but there is a theory that it was caused by some circumstances .
