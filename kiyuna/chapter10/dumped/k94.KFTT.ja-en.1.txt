History
In 1218 , he was born .
July 12 , 645 - Crown Prince
August 24 , 1304 -
February 20 , 668 - ascended the throne .
January 7 , 672 - 46 years old
( In " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he was a disease of the death of a disease , and he was said to have been killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and the theory was that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu and the theory was that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu . )
The Emperor Tenchi was not a great figure in the political history in the middle of the seventh century .
There are some theories about this .
It is an consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu to support the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , the theory that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenmu , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is wrong that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and was a maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
In the historical documents , the age of Emperor Tenmu , who was recorded in the history of the Emperor Tenchi , was the age of Emperor Tenmu , and when he was born , he was born as the older brother of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there are many historical materials that have been seen in the same period as the same historical material , and there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 to nine years .
In response , there is a theory that ' the father of his father was different from his older brother , but the same thing was that his younger brother was the younger brother , ' but he was said to have been the age of age of age , but he died in the age of 16 , and when he died , he died in the age of age of age , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of birth was in the year of the year when the Emperor 's family tree was adopted by the Emperor 's family tree .
According to " ancient times , " there was a theory that he was not rare in the ancient times , and he was not able to succeed the throne , and he was not enthroned after the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi , and the Empress Jito , who had been in the reign of Emperor Tenmu .
Therefore , the relationship was brought to the fact that the relationship was born .
According to the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , it is also different from the fact that the book was compiled , because it is said that the book was compiled , because it was not a different point of history .
( Refer to the section of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )

He gave him a reputation to his death , ' I will not die in life , ' and he tried to give him the position of Kanpaku ( chief adviser to the Emperor ) of the new government .
However , Yoshinobu himself was from the Meiji period when he knew that he knew the existence of Ryoma .
It was not only a limited story , but it was very low to be known as the name of Ryoma after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , and he was criticized by the enemy 's enemy , and he was criticized by the enemy 's enemy .
At this time , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the time was left , but the concubine of Yoshinobu was not able to do , but he was not able to see him , and he was a person who had been able to do so .
However , there is a theory that the reason why Yoshinobu was necessary to fight against the uprising of armed uprising in Edo and Musashi Province was required to have a different opinion , and Yoshinobu was not able to have a different relationship with the Emperor 's enemy , and the other people were not able to prevent the opposition from the other daimyo , and therefore , there was no need to prevent the situation of the war .
Since the new government was considered to be the enemy of the Emperor , it was highly evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were not allowed to leave the temple , and they were regarded as a person who had been confined in Kanei-ji Temple , and therefore , it was considered that he was a person who was a person who was a lord of the Imperial Court , and was also called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , but he was also called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .

This is the " <unk> " ( a book of the history of the <unk> ) .
In the chapter of the chapter of the book , which is recorded in the form of a part of a part , it can be seen that the old age of age was not seen .
The reason why he was at the age of age was not good enough to see the reason why he was at the age of age , and he said ' I am not so hard to be able to be able to be able to be a person ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was not good at the time . '
The book was completed after the death of Yoshinobu , and the book was " Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA " .
When he was considered the Emperor 's enemy , he was given the title of the highest rank of the peerage , and he will be given to the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank of the peerage , and he will be held in a Shinto ritual without a funeral ceremony .
Therefore , the grave of Yoshinobu was not a grave of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , and the Tokugawa family 's grave was also a grave of the Tokugawa family in the Cemetery Cemetery , and a large keyhole-shaped mound was built in the Cemetery Cemetery .
This was because the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was not a simple and a simple and a simple style ( " <unk> " ( the official document of the Emperor ) ) .
When Yoshinobu was pardoned , he was not able to have to give his life to the former shogun 's retainer who had offered to him , and he was not able to live in a life without having a good life , saying ' I have been concerned with Yoshinobu and his behavior with Yoshinobu . '
There are some cases where the image of the image of ' the enemy 's escape ' in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , but it has been recently accepted that the new political system of new political system was established after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and the movement to establish new political system in the new modern political system was also conducted .

The section of Uji Interchange is the IC Interchange .
Therefore , the traffic between the Uji Interchange and the south Interchange of the Uji Interchange is often traffic , and the road is often operated between the east and the west Interchange .
This is because the road is not difficult to avoid traffic because it is a <unk> section , because the road is a <unk> section .

Since the name of Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as " <unk> Shrine " ( the list of shrines ) , there is a theory that the name of the shrine was originally the Imperial Prince of <unk> , and the theory that the name of the shrine was <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the <unk> ( <unk> ) was the <unk> ( the god of the Imperial family ) .
In Ise-jingu Shrine , it is called the " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " when the gods are enshrined in the gods , and when the gods are enshrined in the gods .

The description in mythology
In " Kojiki , " Izanagi was born in the place where Izanagi was born , and he was born when he was born in the land of the dead , and then he was born when he was born .
When he was born from the right eye , he was called the three children of the three children , who was born from the right eye .
Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to rule Takamanohara .
Susanoo , who was entrusted to the sea , continued to leave the country , and he was expelled from Izanagi to be exiled to the country of the country .
Susanoo was in the field of the country to go to the country , and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was in Takamanohara ( high heaven ) , but Amaterasu Omikami was a younger brother of Takamanohara , and he was armed with a armed force .

He was ordered to pass the deity of the god of the <unk> , and dispatched the god of the god .
In the meantime , Ashihara no Nakatsukuni was suppressed and the wife of the grandson of the sun goddess was born , but Ninigi was born in the grandson of Ninigi .
interpretation
In the mythology , there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami is the god of the act of the god of the god of the god , who was born in the mythology , and he followed the order of the god , and the scene where Amaterasu Omikami was the god of the country , and the Emperor who ruled the country was the god of the nation .
Also , there is a view that the god of shrine maiden is the god of ancient times .
The other name ' <unk> ' is a shrine maiden who served the sun god .
There is a theory that the sun god was originally a male god , but there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served the god was the same as the sun god .
Also , there is a theory that the god was the Empress Jito , which was the time of the birth of the Empress Jito , and it is said that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami .
The birth of the god of the sun , Amaterasu Omikami , and Tsukuyomi no kami ( the god of the moon ) , ' <unk> ' ( the first day of the sun ) , ' <unk> ' ( the first day of the sixth century ) , ' <unk> ' ( the first day of the seventh century ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and ' <unk> <unk> ' ( <unk> ) are pointed out .
Also , the god of Ise-jingu Shrine , the shrine of Ise-jingu Shrine , and the <unk> ( the shrine of Ise-jingu Shrine ) , the <unk> ( the shrine of the Imperial Shrine ) , <unk> ( the Imperial Princess ) , <unk> ( the Imperial Princess ) , <unk> ( the Imperial Princess ) , <unk> ( the <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , are also considered to have originated in Taoism .
It is pointed out that the myth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was almost equal to the myth of the myth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , and it is pointed out that the myth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was the ancient times ( 3 - fourth century ) .
There is also a theory that the word " <unk> " ( literally , the sun ) is a Japanese myth that spread in Asia with the <unk> of the Japanese people who spread to Japan along with the <unk> of the world .
There is a theory that the god changed into the third stage in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
The following is the following incident :
645 : The Taika Reforms was held .
The Emperor 's family does not have the enshrined deity of Amaterasu Omikami .
The ' god ' is the ' sun ' ( god ) .
The male god called ' <unk> ' was enshrined .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that have the same name ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
Incidentally , the name of the male god is the name of the grandson of Amaterasu , and is also the name of the Owari clan , the Owari clan , and the founder of the clan .
He was also the younger brother of Ninigi , and he was the grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : Jinshin War
" <unk> " ( <unk> ) is a woman who is enshrined in the sun god , " <unk> " ( <unk> ) .
In this case , the deity is interpreted as the interpretation of the enshrined deity of the deity , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> ' ( a god of a god ) of the god of the <unk> .
In 1952 , the shrine was founded by the Imperial Family .
" Amaterasu " and " The ancestor of the Emperor " are ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created as a model for the god of the god , and was created by the god of the god .
After that , ' Amaterasu ' was called ' <unk> ' ( literally , " great god " ) , and the other than the other gods of the Imperial family were called ' <unk> . '
For example , " Sarashina Nikki " ( the Sarashina Diary ) , ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) is pronounced ' <unk> ' ( the god of the sun ) , and the part of ' Amaterasu ' is pronounced ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) is also pronounced ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In 1880 , the religious debate occurred in the Shinto religion of Shinto in the Shinto religion , which occurred in the Shinto religion of Shinto , which was established in Tokyo , Tokyo .
The Bureau of Shinto was enshrined in the three deities of the gods of the gods of the <unk> ( the three gods of the country ) , the three gods of the shrine , and the four gods of the gods , such as the three gods of the ' Izumo school ' ( the god of Ame no Kami , the god of heaven , and the god of god , and the god of god ) , and the ' Izumo school ' should be the five gods that should be controlled by the ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) , and the ' <unk> ' ( the five gods ) should be controlled by the five gods .
However , the ' Ise school ' which was mainly played mainly in Shinto rituals , was ' the Great Buddha of heaven and earth ' which was the center of the <unk> ( the Great Council of State ) , and the two other gods insisted that the two gods were not just a subject of the world .
In the case , there were various stories about various stories such as ' the number of the Izumo school was to be said to be a good man for the time of the age of the gods ' and ' the family of the House of Sen , who had a strong mind to kill the Imperial Family , should be killed . '
This dispute was the decision of the Emperor Meiji , and the god of Amaterasu Omikami was positioned as the highest rank in the position of Amaterasu Omikami .
It is said that the government recognized that the government was able to control the common people in the form of the basic system in Shinto , and it is said that the modern state was impossible to control the people directly directly by the Shinto religion .
