Brief History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that there was a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains of the mountain where he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , saying , ' I will be killed in the mountains of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain , ' and it is said that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu . )
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
In order to support the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mistake that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , who was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and his older brother , Emperor Tenchi .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that ' the father of his father was a younger brother of his father , ' but there is a theory that ' the younger brother of his older brother , who was a younger brother , was said to be a younger brother , ' but it is said that the age of the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , and when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , he died at the age of 16 .
Therefore , the year of his birth year , the year 614 , was adopted by the Imperial Court in the same year .
" In the ancient times , it was not unusual in the ancient times , " which was not unusual in the ancient times , and it was not unusual for the Emperor Tenchi and Jito ( Empress Jito ) , which was not unusual in the ancient times .
Therefore , there was a misunderstanding .
In addition , there is also a theory that it is different from the fact that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was compiled in the period when it was written as " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' the age of Emperor Tenmu ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was dismissed from his position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms of Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , this theory came to be accepted by this theory .
In addition , the reason why the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication was expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication , and so on , the reason why the Soga clan had been expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , describes that she was a wife of Emperor Kotoku who was a wife of Emperor Tenchi ( the younger maternal half-sister of Emperor Tenchi ) .
Although she was allowed to love love with her paternal half-brothers , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to have a close relationship with his maternal half-brothers , and in fact , he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Ono no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Emperor Saimei , the Imperial Prince succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor , but there is a theory that there was no record of some circumstances .

His mother was Princess Yoshiko ( the third son of the third shogun , Iemitsu TOKUGAWA ) , and his mother was the lawful wife of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA .
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to have been the lawful wife of Hidetada , the lawful wife of Hidetada , but there is a theory that the wife of Kasuga no Tsubone was his mother .
His childhood name was Shichiro .
According to the education policy of Nariaki , who was said to go to the domain of the Mito Domain , he moved to the Mito Domain in seven months after his birth , and he had a lot of military arts and martial arts from the Tokugawa family to succeed to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family .
It seems that Nariaki did not have any attention since the time of Yoshinobu , and when Nariaki was adopted by the other family , Nariaki was not adopted by his eldest son ( legitimate son ) and Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , he was ordered by the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) to the Mito Domain , and was ordered to be the successor of the Hitotsubashi family of the Mito Domain .
After that , he inherited the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and took the name of Yoshinobu from the twelfth Shogun , Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA , and called himself the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi visited the residence of Yoshinobu as a candidate candidate for Shogun 's heir , but he was remonstrated by Masahiro ABE , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
In 1853 , the next shogun , Ieyoshi , died of illness , and the 13th shogun , Iesada TOKUGAWA , who succeeded to the position of the shogun , died in poor health , and the 13th shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , who had succeeded to the throne , had a problem .
There was a conflict between Nariaki and Masahiro ABE , who recommended Yoshinobu , and the lord of the Hikone Domain , Naosuke II , the lord of the Hitotsubashi clan , who was the lord of the Satsuma clan , the lord of the domain , Keifuku TOKUGAWA , who was the lord of the Kishu Domain , Keifuku TOKUGAWA , who was the lord of the Kishu Domain .
The Hitotsubashi group went to O-oku as an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , and in 1858 , Masahiro ABE , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , who had lost their power and became Tairo ( chief minister ) , and Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 , and Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister ) in 1858 .
In the same year , Naosuke II took charge of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan .
Yoshinobu asked Nariaki , the lord of Fukui Domain , and Yoshiakira MATSUDAIRA , who was the lord of the Fukui Domain , but on the other hand , he was sentenced to retire in the following year , and in 1859 , he was suspended by his retirement in 1859 ( Ansei no Taigoku [ Ansei no Taigoku ] ) .
On the other hand , when Yoshinobu was not able to become the heir of shogun , he sent his letter to Nariaki , saying , ' I will not be able to take over the country , but I will not take over the country . '
In 1860 , he was confined .
In 1862 , when the Satsuma army of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU entered Edo , the Imperial envoy , Shigetomi OHARA , went to Edo , and ordered the Emperor Komei , who was the guardian of the shogun , and the Emperor Komei , who was the Shogun 's guardian , should be appointed to Tairo ( chief minister ) .
On July 6 , the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) was appointed to Yoshinobu , and Shungaku was appointed to the post of president of Shungaku .
On the occasion of the Bunkyu Reforms , Shungaku carried out the reform of the shogunate government , which was called the Bunkyu Reforms , and in the case of Sankinkotai ( a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code ) , he was established .
In 1863 , he went to Kyoto as a member of the Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA , and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court with the expulsion of foreigners .
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine , Iemochi was given an audience with Iemochi , who was given an audience with the Emperor , and he was forced to take an audience with Iemochi , and he was forced to take an audience with Iemochi .
In the Coup of August 18 , the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the expulsion of foreigners ) and the Sonno Joi ha ( supporters of the expulsion of foreigners ) were expelled by the Choshu Domain , and in the conference , he went to Kyoto again to participate in the conference .
However , if the conference did not have any conference , he became drunk at the sake brewery with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , who had been drunk at the meeting with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko , who had been drunk at the meeting , and he made a violent saying , ' I am to get off from Shimazu from Shimazu , ' and so on .
After that , the Imperial Court stayed in Kyoto and was appointed to the Governor-General of the Imperial Court , and was appointed to the post of Shugo ( provincial constable ) , Katamori MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Aizu Domain ) , and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) ( the lord of the Kuwana Domain ) , who was a loyal retainer of the Imperial Court , and took control of the court nobles and court nobles .
In the Rebellion of Tenguto , the retainers of the Mito Domain , such as Yusai TAKEDA , who supported Yoshinobu supported Yoshinobu , and the retainers of the Mito Domain , who supported Yoshinobu .

On July 20 , the second conquest of Choshu , Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle .
Yoshinobu issued an imperial rescript to the Imperial Court , and succeeded to the conclusion of the war .
He was recommended by Iemochi , but Yoshinobu refused this .
On August 20 , the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of shogun , but he continued to resign .
After that , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) asked the shogun , and on December 5 , he was given the title of shogun to Shogun , and on December 5 , he assumed the position of shogun .
In this way , the shogun was able to become a shogun , and he tried to take advantage of politics .
Yoshinobu , who was a minister of France , was a French minister , and he established a military reform of 240,000 dolls from France to 240 million liters , and established a military system to establish a military system to establish a military reform .
In addition , he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA , who was a retainer of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , who sent his younger brother , Akitake TOKUGAWA .
In the issue of Hyogo Port , he received an imperial sanction by the Imperial Court .

However , in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3 , the army of the former bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) and the army of the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) did not have any military power , and in the battle , he retreated to Edo and retreated to Edo in " Kaiyo maru . "

It is said that his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , tried to take the tonsure when his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , became a member of the Tokugawa family when he was the successor of the Tokugawa family , and when he went to the front , he made a sword to make a sword .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote about the assassination of the assassination of the Emperor .
Although it is said that the photograph of Yoshinobu was his childhood , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who had been ill , and at that time , it is said that it was a meeting .
He was known by his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , and his real father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , praised Yoshinobu as ' the head of the Tokugawa family , ' and he was given the position of shogun to the shogun , saying that ' Ieyasu TOKUGAWA rewarded the line of Tokugawa , ' and he was praised as the shogun to become a shogun .
Yoshinobu , who was also known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , was also known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain was not known .
He was in charge of the reclamation of Ieyasu .
Ryoma SAKAMOTO and Ryoma SAKAMOTO visited the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
They are not able to pay it , but they are not able to pay it .
As a result , he received the evaluation of his life , saying , ' I will give him the position of Kanpaku ( chief adviser to the Emperor ) of the new government . '
However , in the Meiji period ( after the death of Ryoma ) , there was a person named Ryoma .
Although it was not only limited to Yoshinobu , the name of Ryoma was very very low than that after the Meiji Restoration .
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , he was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , and he was criticized by the enemy of the enemy .
At that time , there were some people who were forbidden by Ieyasu , but there were some people who could not forget that they could not forget their favorite mistresses .
However , there is a theory that it was necessary to prevent the military force in Edo and Musashi Province , and when Yoshinobu became the enemy of the Imperial Court , he was forced to defend the Osaka-jo Castle because Yoshinobu was the enemy of the Imperial Court , and therefore , there was no need to prevent foreign countries to prevent foreign countries .
Since the new government was considered to be the enemy of the new government , it is evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were highly regarded as a person who had been confined in Kanei-ji Temple and confined himself in Kanei-ji Temple , and therefore , it was also said that the Emperor and the Imperial Court did not show the fact that he was the lord of the Emperor and the Imperial Court , however , he was also said to have been the lord of his lord .
It is highly evaluated that the independence of the government was to be transferred to the Meiji Restoration due to the fact that he was forced to move to the government due to his discretion , and he was able to transfer the government to the Meiji Restoration .

In the later years of Yoshinobu , Shibuzawa tried to persuade Yoshinobu in his later years , and established a ' Yakuyukai ' ( a dream of a dream ) , who had been persuaded by Yoshinobu .
It is written in " Yakuyukai Shoki " ( The Record of Yume Yume ) .
It is written in the style of a part of a part of the story , and it can be seen in the old age of Yoshinobu 's old age .
It is said that he was good at the time when he was at the age of age , saying , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was not very good , but Hisamitsu SHIMAZU , who was not a good person , was a person who was not good , ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a man . '
These materials were completed after the death of Yoshinobu , and " Tokugawa Yoshinobu koden " ( Biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show respect to the Emperor Meiji , who was considered to be the enemy of the Imperial Court , Yoshinobu , who was the highest rank of kazoku ( the highest rank in the Heian period ) , told him to show respect to the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank for the peerage .
For this reason , the grave of Yoshinobu was not a graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , which was also a graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , and a large keyhole-shaped tomb mound was built at the site of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family .
This was because the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was a complaint , and it was because the Imperial mausoleum of the Emperor Komei .
After he was pardoned , he spent his life as a retainer of the former retainers of the former shogun , Shizuka ITAKURA , saying that he would have been good for his life , saying , ' I want to take action with Yoshinobu . '
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , there was a strong image of a weak image in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , but in recent years , he tried to establish a new political system after the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and in addition to the broadcasting of the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he was reevaluated .
His father , Nariaki , was a specialty of the Satsuma Domain , and it was called ' bubu sama ' ( a kind of pork and pork ) .
