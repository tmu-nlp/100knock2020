Brief History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( The History of Japan ) , there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains , which is said to have been written by the Emperor Tenmu , and it is said that there was a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains , and there is a theory that he was assassinated by Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
It is an order to support the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mistake that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , who was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and was the older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that ' the father of his father was a younger brother of his father , ' however , there is a theory that ' the younger brother of his brother , who was a younger brother of his brother , was said to be a younger brother , ' but it is said that the age of the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , and when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , he died at the age of 16 .
Therefore , the year of his birth year , the year 614 , was adopted by the Imperial Court in the same year .
" In the ancient times , there was not a rare case in the ancient times , " and it was not unusual in the ancient times , and the Emperor was not enthroned by the Emperor Tenchi and Jito ( Empress Jito ) .
Therefore , there was a misunderstanding .
In addition , there is also a theory that the book is different from the fact that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was compiled in the era of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which is the same as that of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' the age of Emperor Tenmu ' )
The Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was dismissed from his position .
In recent years , the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , according to the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , this theory came to be accepted .
In addition , the reason why the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication was banished due to the fact that the Soga clan was banished after a coup d 'etat after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , describes that she was a wife of Emperor Kotoku who was a wife of Emperor Tenchi ( the younger maternal half-sister of Emperor Tenchi ) .
Although she was allowed to love love with her half-brothers and sisters , she was not allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to have a close relationship with his maternal half-sister , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , but he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of the Emperor Saimei , Princess Hime succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor , but there is a theory that there was no record of this situation .
