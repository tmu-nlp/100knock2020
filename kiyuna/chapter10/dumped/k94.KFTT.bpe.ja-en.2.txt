It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
It is a feelings that the Emperor Tenmu recommended Emperor Tenmu .
It is a misunderstanding that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi and the Emperor Tenmu , who was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and the Emperor was a son of Emperor Jomei , who was the older maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
The Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenmu at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and the year after the death of Emperor Tenchi .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that the Emperor 's death was not good , but it was said that the Emperor 's death was not good , but the fact that the Emperor 's age of age was said to be the age of the Emperor Tenchi , but the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of sixteen years old , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of birth was in 614 , which was written in the same year , and in 614 , the year of the same year .
" In the ancient times , " the theory of " ancient times " was not rare in the ancient times , and it was not unusual in the ancient times , and it was not unusual that the Emperor was enthroned as the Emperor , and the Emperor was not enthroned .
It was a misunderstanding that it was a mistake .
There is also an opinion that the book is different from the fact that the book was compiled in the period when the book was compiled in the book " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which is also written as " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu age ' )

In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar .
In this way , the reason why Prince Naka no Oe killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , this theory was accepted by the fact that the reconstruction of the Taika Reforms .

It is said that he had a sword to make a sword in order to make a sword in the Makura ( the Makura ) , when his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , became a member of the Tokugawa family when he was the successor of the Tokugawa family , and he had a sword in order to make a sword .
On the other hand , there is an anecdote that he had a wife and his wife , who was the same person as the assassination of the assassination of the assassination of the assassination of the Emperor .
Although it is said that the photographs of Yoshinobu was a child , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu .
It is said that he visited Iemochi who had been ill in his illness , and at that time , he met with the general public .
He was known for his career , and his real father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , praised Yoshinobu as ' the head of the Tokugawa family , ' and his father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , praised him as ' the rebel of Tokugawa , ' and he was praised as the shogun to become shogun , and he was praised as the shogun to become shogun .
Yoshinobu , who was known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , had been known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain was not a talent of Yoshinobu HIBASHI .
He was also said to be the rebel of Ieyasu .
Sakamoto SAKAMOTO , who was the head of the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , visited the country , and Ryoma SAKAMOTO visited this .
It is not possible to make it possible to pay it .
He gave him to his own life , saying , ' I will give him to the position of Kanpaku ( chief adviser to the Emperor ) of the new government , ' and he tried to give him the position of chief adviser to the new government .
However , it was from the Meiji period when Yoshinobu had known about the existence of Ryoma .
Although he was not only a talented story , he was very very low for the time after the Meiji Restoration .
He was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , and he was criticized by his enemy , and was criticized by his enemy .
At that time , the seal of the gold fan was forbidden , but there were some people who were disguised by his favorite mistress , who were not forbidden .
However , there is a theory that it was necessary to prevent the military force in Edo and Musashi Province , and because Yoshinobu was the enemy of the Imperial Court , he was not able to defend the castle , and he was also defended by the bakufu , and therefore , he was not able to prevent foreign countries to prevent foreign countries .
Since the new government was considered to be the enemy of the new government , it is evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were considered to be a person who had been confined in Kanei-ji Temple , and he was considered to be a person who was a person who had been confined in Kanei-ji Temple , and he was also said to have been a person who was a person of the Emperor and the Imperial Court , but he was also said to have been the lord of the family , so he was also said to have been the lord of the family .
It is highly evaluated that the independence of the government was to be transferred to the Meiji Restoration due to the fact that he was forced to move to the government due to his discretion and the castle of the Edo period , and he was given a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal who was a vassal of the Tokugawa family , and after the Meiji Restoration , he had a close relationship with the Meiji Restoration .

It is written in " Yume Yai Shoki " ( The Record of Yume Yume ) .
In the form of a part of a part of a story , the word is written in the form of an old age , and it can be seen in the old age of Yoshinobu .
When he was born , he was very good at that time , and he was very good at that time , ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was very good , ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was not good at him . '
This book was completed after the death of Yoshinobu , but it was written by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .
In order to show respect to the Emperor Meiji , who was considered to be the enemy of the Imperial Court , Yoshinobu ordered the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank for the peerage , and he told him to be a Shinto ritual .
For this reason , the grave of Yoshinobu was not a member of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , and was also built at the site of the Tokugawa family of the Kanei-ji Temple , which was also a tomb of the Tokugawa family , and a large keyhole-shaped tomb mound was built in the vicinity of the family of the Tokugawa family .
This was because the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was a phonetic , and it was because the Imperial mausoleum of the Emperor Komei was a complaint . ( " Megawa Yoshinobu Ken " ) .
After pardoning , Yoshinobu had to give his life to the former retainers of the former Shogunate , Shizuka ITAKURA , who had been alive , saying , ' I will reregain his action to Yoshinobu , ' and after that , he wrote that ' Yoshinobu and his actions were together with Yoshinobu . '
There is an image of a weak image in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , but it is also said that it was a new political system after the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and in addition to the broadcasting of the new political system after the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , it was also reevaluated , and the TV program of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ( NHK Taiga Drama ) .
His father , Nariaki , was a good food , and was called a pork of the Satsuma Domain , and was called ' bubu ' ( a kind of pork ) .
