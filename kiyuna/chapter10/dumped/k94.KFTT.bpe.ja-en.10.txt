Brief History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that there was a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed in the mountains and was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and it is said that there was a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination was killed by the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
In order to support the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mistake that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , who was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and was the older brother of Emperor Tenchi .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a claim that ' the father of his father was a younger brother of his father , ' but there is a theory that says that ' the younger brother of his older brother was a younger brother , ' but in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , and when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , he died at the age of 16 .
Therefore , the year of birth in Honcho was adopted in 614 , the year 614 .
" In the ancient times , it was not unusual in the ancient times , " which was not unusual in the ancient times , and it was not unusual in the era of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jito , which was not unusual in the ancient times .
As a result , there was a misunderstanding .
In addition , there is also a theory that the book is different from the fact that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which is said to be the same as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was compiled .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu age ' ) .
The Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was deprived of his position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms of Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , this theory came to be accepted by this theory .
According to this theory , the reason why the Soga clan was expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication of the throne , so the reason why the Soga clan had not been expelled after the death of the Emperor Kogyoku .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , had a relationship with Emperor Tenchi and Emperor Tenchi ( the younger sister of Emperor Tenchi ) in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
Although she was allowed to love love with her paternal half-brothers , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to have a close relationship with his maternal half-brothers , and in fact , he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was disguised by his uncle , Prince Okaru ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Emperor Saimei , the Imperial Prince succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor , but there is a theory that there was no record of these circumstances .
In " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that there was a person who had a person who was called ' the Imperial Prince ' in the " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , and it is said that the Emperor was the Emperor who was the Emperor 's successor to the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .

On the other hand , there is an anecdote about the assassination of the assassination of the Emperor .
Although it is said that the photograph of Yoshinobu was his childhood , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu , but it is doubtful whether he was a child of Yoshinobu .
It is said that he visited Iemochi , who was sick , and at that time , at that time , it is said that it was a meeting .
He was known for his real father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , and his real father , Nariaki TOKUGAWA , praised Yoshinobu as ' the head of the Tokugawa family , ' and he was given the position of shogun to the shogun , saying that ' Ieyasu TOKUGAWA rewarded the line of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA , ' and he was praised as a member of the shogun .
Yoshinobu , who was also known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , was well known for the overthrowing of the Shogunate , and Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain was not known .
He was in charge of the reclamation of Ieyasu .
Ryoma SAKAMOTO and Ryoma SAKAMOTO visited the decision of Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) .
Also , it is not possible to pay it , but it is not able to pay it .
As a result , he received the evaluation of his life , saying , ' I will give him the position of Kanpaku ( chief adviser to the Emperor ) of the new government . '
However , in the Meiji period ( after the death of Ryoma ) , there was a person named Ryoma .
Although he was not only limited to Yoshinobu , he was very very low than that of Ryoma 's name after the Meiji Restoration .
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , he was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , and he was criticized by the enemy of the enemy .
At this time , there were some people who were forbidden that they were forbidden by Ieyasu , but there were some people who could not forget that they could not forget them .
However , there is also a theory that it was necessary to defend the battle between Edo and Musashi Province because Yoshinobu was in charge of armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province , and when Yoshinobu became the enemy of the Imperial Court , he was obliged to defend the Osaka-jo Castle .
Since the new government was considered to be the enemy of the new government , it is evaluated that the Emperor and the Imperial Court were highly regarded as a person who had been confined in Kanei-ji Temple and confined himself in Kanei-ji Temple , and therefore , he was also said to have been a person of the Emperor and the Imperial Court ; however , he was also said to have been the lord of the Imperial Court , and therefore , he was also called ' the waist . '
It is highly evaluated that the independence of the government was to be transferred to the Meiji Restoration due to the fact that he was forced to transfer the government to the Meiji Restoration due to the fact that he was confined to the castle .
Eichi SHIBUSAWA , a businessman , was a vassal of the Tokugawa family , and after the Meiji Restoration , he had a close friendship after the Meiji Restoration .
In his later years , Shibuzawa tried to persuade Yoshinobu in his later years , and established the ' Yakuyukai ' ( a dream of Yume ) , who had been persuaded to persuade Yoshinobu .
It is written in " The Tale of Ancient Matters . "
In the form of zodankai , it can be seen in the form of an old age , and it can be seen as an old age .
At the time of the age of the age , it was very good at that time , and it is said that ' Hisamitsu SHIMAZU was very good , ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was not good , ' and ' Naomasa NABESHIMA was a person who was very good . '
These materials were completed after the death of Yoshinobu , and " Tokugawa Yoshinobu koden " ( Biography of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA ) .
In order to show respect to the Emperor Meiji , who was considered to be the enemy of the Imperial Court , Yoshinobu , who was the highest rank of kazoku ( the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests ) , told him to show respect to the Emperor Meiji , who was the highest rank for the peerage .
For this reason , the grave of Yoshinobu was not a graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , which was also a graveyard of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family , and a keyhole-shaped tomb mound was built at the site of the Tokugawa family of the Tokugawa family .
This was because the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was a complaint , and it was because the Imperial mausoleum of the Emperor Komei .
After he was pardoned , the former retainers of the former retainers of the former Shogunate , Shizuka ITAKURA , who had been given to his own life , gave him to his own life , saying , ' I want to take action with Yoshinobu . '
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , there was an image of a weak image in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi , but in recent years , he tried to establish a new political system after Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , and in addition to the broadcasting broadcasting of the Taisei Hokan ( transfer of power back to the Emperor ) , he was reevaluated .
His father , Nariaki , was a specialty of the Satsuma Domain , and it was called ' bubu sama ' ( a kind of pork and pork ) .
In addition , in his later years , he gained interest in the Western culture , and in his later years , he was interested in a photographs such as a photographs , such as a photographs , a camilar , a camphor , a camphor , and so on , but in the era of the shogun , he was also said to have learned French , and he was also able to learn French .
It is famous as a Mramman , but it seems that the technique of studio was not promoted .
His photographs was often found in photographs , but it is said that he was not adopted .
In addition , the photographs of the great-grandchild , Yoshiyuki TOKUGAWA , was a Mramman Mramman , and the photographs was found by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA , and the photographs were found in the possession of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA .

According to " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the shrine was changed into three times .
The following is based on the contents of the incident .
645 : The Taika Reforms .
The Emperor is not enshrined in the Imperial Family before this time .
The ' sun ' ( literally , ' sun ' ) , ' Taiyo ' ( the sun goddess ) .
The male god called ' Maro ' was also enshrined .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there is a shrine named ' Marutamaru ' ( Marutin ) in Tsushima , and ' Amatamaru no mikoto ' in Harima Province , ' Amaterasu Omitama no Mikoto ' in Tanba , ' Amaterasu Omitama no Mikoto ' and so on .
According to the name of Amaterasu , Amenohibari , the grandson of Amaterasu , is the name of Amenohibari , the grandson of Amaterasu , and the ancestor of the clan of the Owari clan and the Nabe clan .
The younger brother of Amenohibari was Ninigi , and was the great-grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : The Jinshin War .
" Oohimome " ( literally , the sun goddess ) , " the daughter of the sun god , " ' Tanaka no kami ' ( a daughter of the sun goddess ) .

698 : The shrine was founded .
It is ' Amaterasu , the ancestor of the Emperor and the emperor . '
She is a female god .
It was founded as a model for the Emperor Jito as a model .
Even after that , ' Tensho ' other than the ancestor of the Imperial family was called ' Maru . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( The Diary of Sarashina Nikki ) ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' Tensho ' is read as ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( literally , ' the god of heaven ) ' and ' Amaterasu Omikami ' in " The former Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
In 1880 - 1881 , there was a controversy dispute over the enshrined deity of Shinden ( Shinto shrine ) of Shinto , which was established in Hibiya , Tokyo .
The Bureau of Shinto Shrines insisted that the enshrined deity of the shrine was enshrined as the enshrined deity in the Shinden ( the main hall ) of the Bureau of Shinto Shrines and the four pillars of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , but the ' Izumo-ha ' ( the Izumo school ) , which means ' the world of the world , should be divided into five pillars , ' and that the ' Izumo school ' refers to the five pillars of Okuninushi no Okami ( the god of the great Okuninushi ) who ruled the country .
However , the ' Ise school ' who played the central part of the Shinto office was a ' Tenchi Daishu ' ( Great Buddha of the Great Buddha ) , which means that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was a vassal of Kenyu and the other gods insisted that there was a conflict between the two gods and other gods .
In the fruit , there were various theories , such as ' The school of the Izumo school has been unable to kill the Imperial Family , ' and ' the Imperial Family should be killed by the Imperial Family , ' and so on .
Before long , the dispute was decided by the Emperor Meiji , and the gods of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were regarded as the highest rank .
In addition , it is said that the government recognized that the government could not control the common people directly by the Meiji Government , and it is said that the modern nation could not control the common people directly by the modern nation .

This is because the name of ' Tensho Okami ' ( Amaterasu Omikami ) , which is the title of the ancestor of the emperor , appears in the Bunbun , so it is because the god of the sun sun and the god should not be used as a god .
In fact , there is a large number of people who did not have a lot of armies in the novel by AKUTAGAWA 's novel .
Masaatsu YASUOKA ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who was established in the Konchigaku-in Temple ( 1898 - 1983 ) was a belief of Amaterasu Omikami ( Sun Goddess ) .
