Brief Personal History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became the Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( The History of Japan ) , there is a theory that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , saying , ' The Emperor is the mountain of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain , ' and it is said that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu ) .
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mystery in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
It is an order to support the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a misunderstanding that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi and the Emperor Tenmu , who was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and the Emperor was a son of Emperor Jomei , who was the older maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that ' the father of his father was a younger brother of his father , ' but it is said that ' the younger brother of his older brother , who was a younger brother , was said to be a younger brother , ' but it is said that the age of the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , which was the age of sixteen years old when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of this year was in 614 , which was adopted by the Imperial Court in the same year .
" In the ancient times , " in " ancient times , it was not unusual in the ancient times , " and it was not unusual for the Emperor Tenchi and Jito ( Empress Jito , who had already been enthroned in the era of Emperor Tenmu ) .
This was because there was a misunderstanding .
In addition , there is also a theory that it is not possible when the book was compiled in the era of " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which was written in the same manner as " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu age ' ) .
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was dismissed from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , this theory was accepted by this theory .
In this theory , the reason why the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication was banned by the Soga clan , who had not been expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication , and so on .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku who was described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , had a relationship with Emperor Tenchi and Emperor Tenchi ( the younger sister of Emperor Tenchi ) .
Although she was allowed to love love with her half-brothers , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to have a close relationship with his brother , Prince Okaru , who was a sister of Chiko SANAKA , but he was disguised by his uncle , Ono no Okimi , who had been disguised by his uncle , Ono no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Emperor Saimei , the Imperial Princess was succeeded to the throne as the wife of the emperor , but there is a theory that it was caused by some circumstances .
