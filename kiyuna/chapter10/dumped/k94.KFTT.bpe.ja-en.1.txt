" The ancient times in ancient times , " and " ancient times , " was not unusual in the ancient times , and the Emperor was not enthroned as the Emperor Tenchi , and the Emperor was not enthroned .

It is said that the Princess was succeeded by the Imperial Prince after the death of Emperor Saimei , but there is a theory that it was written by the Emperor 's wife .
This is a theory that the person who was called ' the Imperial Prince ' in " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) was a person who was the Emperor 's wife , and the Emperor was the Emperor 's second emperor who was the Emperor 's second emperor .
There is a theory that the Princess was called ' Nakasakino no mikoto ' and ' the Imperial Princess , ' but it is not necessarily certain that she was the Emperor Saimei , but there is no evidence to be certain .
