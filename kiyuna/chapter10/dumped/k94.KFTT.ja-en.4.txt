August 24 , 1304 - Imperial Court
February 20 , 668 - ascended the throne .
January 7 , 672 - 46 years old
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he died from illness in the mountain , ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ' ) .
It was a historical history in the middle of the seventh century when Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne .
There are several theories about this .
To support the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , the theory that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenmu , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , but it is wrong to say that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and he was a maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
According to the history of the Emperor Tenmu , the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenmu , which was written in the history of the history of the Emperor Tenchi and a part of a part of a part of a part of the history of the Emperor Tenmu .
However , there are many historical materials about the age of nine to nine years old , and there are many historical materials that have a difference between eight to nine years .
On the other hand , however , there is a theory that ' his father was different from his older brother , but his younger brother was a younger brother , ' but it is said that he died in the age of age of age of age , but he died in the age of age of age of age , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , and he died in the age of 16 , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the birth year of the birth of the real year was born , which was adopted by the Emperor 's family tree .
According to " ancient times , " there is a theory that he was not rare in the ancient times , and he was not able to ascend the throne , and he was not enthroned after the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito .
Therefore , it was caused by the fact that there was a rumor .
According to the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is another opinion that it was not the same as that of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and there is another opinion that it was not the same .
( Refer to the section of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
It is said that the Incident of the Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat by Prince Oama ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe no Oji was driven out of the position .
It is pointed out that the relationship between Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe killed Iruka .
In the article of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , this theory was accepted by this theory .
In this theory , the reason why the Soga clan of the Soga clan , who had been expelled from the Soga clan , was expelled from the coup by the Retired Emperor Kogyoku , and the reason why the Soga clan was not expelled after a coup d 'etat .
It is said that the enthronement of the Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition of the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was a poem that had a relationship with Emperor Tenchi ( the younger sister of Emperor Tenchi ) , and there is a view that she was a close relationship with Emperor Tenchi .
Although she was not allowed to marry her younger paternal half-brother , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to marry her younger brothers , but he was not allowed to have a relationship with his older sister , <unk> ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was impressed by the fact that he had a relationship with his uncle , <unk> no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was impressed by his uncle <unk> no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Empress Saimei , the Imperial Throne was given to the throne as the wife of the second emperor of the Emperor , but it is said that there was no record of some reasons .

Ryotaro SHIBA said that " <unk> " was a family line of a person who was in the family line of the Emperor , but it can be confirmed that he was deeply respected by the feudal lord of Higo Domain , who had been involved in the overthrow of the Shogunate , and it is possible that he was deeply loved by a wide range .
On September 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the lawful wife , Princess Yoshiko ( the third son of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA , who was the real mother of the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA . )
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to have been the lawful wife of Hidetada 's father , Hidetada , but it is also said that Kasuga no tsubone was the mother of Kasuga no tsubone .

On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , who was from the bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) as a successor to the Hitotsubashi family , became the successor of the Hitotsubashi family .
In response to this , he inherited the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he was given the name of the twelfth shogun , Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA from the name of the twelfth shogun , Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi had to visit the Hitotsubashi residence as a candidate candidate for the successor of the Shogun , but he gave up to him as a candidate for the successor to the Shogun , but he gave up up to the post of roju ( senior councilor ) Masahiro ABE .
In 1853 , when the arrival of the Black Ships , Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness and the 13th shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , who succeeded to the position of the head of the family , had no chance to succeed the position of the shogun ( Shogun 's heir ) , and the issue of the 13th shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , who had a son , had a son .

The Hitotsubashi group tried to take up the support of the shogun , who was an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to the O-oku ( the inner halls of inner palace guards ) as Shogun , and in order to raise the support of the shogun , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , who had lost its power , had lost power , and Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister of state ) in 1858 , was decided to be appointed as Tairo ( chief minister ) .

The Imperial Family does not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this .
It is ' <unk> ' ( the god of the sun ) and ' the sun of the sun . '
The male god called ' <unk> ' was widely enshrined .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there is a shrine named ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> Shrine ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .

The shrine was founded by the Imperial Family at the same time as <unk> Shrine .
" Amaterasu , " ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family , ' ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created as a model for the god of the god , and was created by the god of the god .
After that , ' Amaterasu ' was called ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> . '
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( the Sarashina Diary ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) was read as ' <unk> , ' and the ' <unk> ' was read as ' <unk> ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .

The Bureau of Shinto was enshrined as the enshrined deity in the shrine 's shrine , and the four gods of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were enshrined in the shrine , but the ' Izumo school ' insisted that the ' Izumo school ' should be divided into five pillars , including the ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) , ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) , and ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) should be divided into five pillars .
However , the ' Ise school , ' which played the central role of Shinto rituals , was the ' <unk> ' ( the world of heaven and earth ) , which was the center of the <unk> ( the Great Council of State ) , and the two other gods insisted that the two gods were not just a subject of each other .
On the other hand , there were various stories such as ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '
Before long , this dispute was decided by the Emperor Meiji , and the god of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was positioned as the highest rank .
In addition , it is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the basic system in Shinto , and it is said that the modern state was impossible to control the common people directly directly by the Shinto religion of Shinto .

This was because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) was written as ' <unk> ' ( the god of the sun ) , so it was not used for the sun god and the god of the sun , so it was not necessary to use ' <unk> ' ( the sun god ) .
