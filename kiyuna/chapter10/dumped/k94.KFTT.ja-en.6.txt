History
Established : He was born .
July 12 , 645 - Crown Prince
August 24 , 1304 - Imperial Court
February 20 , 668 - ascended the throne .
January 7 , 672 - 46 years old
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he died from illness in " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , and there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu .
Since Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne in the middle of the seventh century , he was a great figure in political history in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
To support the power of the Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , the theory that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenmu , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , but it is wrong to say that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and was a maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
However , when the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenmu in the history of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of birth , and the Emperor Tenmu became the older prince .
However , there are many historical documents about the age of nine to nine to nine years old .
On the other hand , however , there is a theory that ' his father was different from his older brother , but his younger brother was a younger brother , ' but it is said that he died in the age of age of age of age , but he died in the age of age of age , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , and he died in the age of 16 , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of the birth of the real year was born , which was adopted by the imperial family of the Imperial family .
According to " ancient times , " it was not rare in the ancient times , and it was not rare in the ancient times , and it was not unusual for the Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito , who had already been enthroned after the enthronement of Emperor Tenmu .
Therefore , it was caused by the fact that there was a rumor .
According to " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is another opinion that it was not the same as that of " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , and there is another opinion that it was not the same .
( Refer to the section of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
It is said that the Incident of Isshi was a coup d 'etat by Prince Oama ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe no Oji was driven out of the position .
It has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was relatively good in recent years .
As a result , Prince Naka no Oe killed Iruka .
In the article of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there was a theory that this theory came to be accepted .
In this theory , the reason why the Soga clan of the Soga clan , which was the reason for the abdication of Emperor Kogyoku , was expelled from a coup d 'etat by the Soga clan , which was the reason for the enthronement of the Emperor Kogyoku , and so on .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was delayed due to the opposition of the women of the Emperor Tenchi .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was a poem composed by the wife of Emperor Kotoku ( younger sister of Emperor Tenchi ) , and there is a view that she was a close relationship with Emperor Tenchi .
Although she was not allowed to marry her younger paternal half-brother , she was allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed , but he was not allowed to be allowed to marry her younger brothers , but he was not allowed to have a relationship with his older sister , <unk> no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was impressed by the fact that he had a relationship with his uncle , <unk> no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and he was impressed by his uncle <unk> no Okimi ( Emperor Kotoku ) .
It is said that after the death of Empress Saimei , Emperor Saimei succeeded to the throne as the wife of the second emperor , but there is a theory that he was given the Imperial Throne as a wife of the Emperor .
According to " Manyoshu " ( Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves ) , there is a theory that the person who was ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) was born from the theory that ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) was the Emperor who was the Emperor before the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi .
There is a theory that she was called ' <unk> ' because she was not called ' <unk> , ' but there is a theory that she was called ' <unk> ' , but there is a theory that he was Empress Saimei .
