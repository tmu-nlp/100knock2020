July 12 , 645 - Crown Prince
August 24 , 1689 -
February 20 , 668 - ascended the throne .
January 7 , 672 - 46 years old
( In " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he died in the mountain , saying that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and the theory was that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and the theory was that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu . )
It was a political history in the middle of the seventh century when Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne .
There are several theories about this .
To support the power of Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , the theory that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenmu , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , but it is wrong to say that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and he was a maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
According to the history of the Emperor Tenmu , the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenmu , which was written in the history of the history of the Emperor Tenchi , and when he was born , the Emperor Tenmu became the older prince .
However , there are many historical materials about the age of nine to nine years old , and there are many historical materials that have a difference between eight to nine years .
On the other hand , there is a theory that ' his father was different from his older brother , but his younger brother was the younger brother , ' but it is said that he died in the age of age of age of age , but he died in the age of age of age of age , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne , saying that he was the age of age of age , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the birth year of the birth of the real year was born , which was adopted by the imperial family of the Imperial family .
According to " ancient times , " there is a theory that he was not rare in the ancient times , and he was not able to ascend the throne , and he was not enthroned after the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito .
Therefore , it was caused by the fact that there was a difference in the relationship between them .
According to the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is another opinion that it was not the same as that , because it is said that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) was compiled , there is another opinion that it was not the same .
( Refer to the section of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
It is said that the Incident of Isshi was a coup d 'etat by Prince Oama ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe no Oji was expelled from his position .
It is pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy .
The reason why Prince Naka no Oe killed Iruka .
In the article of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , it was accepted that the theory was accepted by this theory .
In this theory , the reason why the Soga clan of the Soga clan , who had been expelled from the Soga clan , was expelled from the coup by the Retired Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication of the throne , and the reason why the Soga clan was not exiled .

His name is also written as ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> . '
In Mito City , which is a place where it is located , it is often called ' <unk> , ' but it is often called ' <unk> ' in Shizuoka City , where he spent his life .
When he was alive , he was called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) because he was a person who knew Yoshinobu 's death , and he was called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and he was called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
It is said that <unk> TOKUGAWA , who succeeded to Yoshinobu , was called ' <unk> ' from people around the same time .
Although the name ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' are not confirmed , it is considered that the name ' <unk> ' is not limited to Shizuoka , but it is often used in many places , and it is often used to be used in many cases .
Ryotaro SHIBA said that ' the person who was called " <unk> " was a family line of a person who was in the Kamakura bakufu ( Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , but it is possible that he was deeply respected by the feudal lord of Higo Domain , who had been seen in a wide range , because it was possible that he was familiar with a wide range .
On September 29 , 1837 , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA , the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Koishikawa , Edo .
His mother was the lawful wife , Princess Yoshiko ( the third son of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA , who was the real mother of the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA . )
However , the real mother of Iemitsu is said to have been the lawful wife of Hidetada 's father , Hidetada , but it is also said that Kasuga no tsubone was the mother of Kasuga no tsubone .

It seems that he had been attracted attention from the time of Yoshinobu 's death , and it was thought that Nariaki could not be adopted by other families , but he thought that Nariaki could not leave the family to be an adopted son of the first son ( legitimate son ) , TOKUGAWA TOKUGAWA .
On August 1 , 1847 , the bakufu decided to take the position of the head of the Hitotsubashi family from the bakufu to the Mito Domain as a successor to the Hitotsubashi family .
In response to this , he inherited the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 , and in December , he was given the name of the twelfth shogun , Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA from the name of the twelfth shogun , Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA .
Ieyoshi had to visit the Hitotsubashi residence as a candidate candidate for the successor of the Shogun , but he gave up the support of the Shogun 's heir , Masahiro ABE .
In 1853 , when the arrival of the Black Ships , Ieyoshi and Ieyoshi died of illness , and the 13th shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA , who succeeded the position of the shogun , had a strong possibility that he had a son , and he could not have a son with a son of the 13th shogun , Iesada TOKUGAWA .
In addition to Nariaki who recommended Yoshinobu , the lord of the Hikone group , including Nariaki , Masahiro ABE , the lord of the Satsuma clan , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , the lord of the Kishu Domain , and the lord of the Hikone clan , who was the lord of the Kishu Domain , were opposed to the confrontation between the Hitotsubashi group of the Tokugawa family , the real mother of Iesada , and the real mother of Iesada .
The Hitotsubashi group tried to take up the support of the shogun , who was an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU , to the O-oku ( the inner halls of inner palace guards ) as Shogun , and in order to raise the support of the shogun , Nariakira SHIMAZU , and Nariakira SHIMAZU , who had lost power , were defeated , and Naosuke II , who became Tairo ( chief minister of state ) in 1858 , had lost power , and he was appointed as Tairo ( chief minister ) .

On the other hand , he sent a letter to Nariaki that he could not become an heir to the shogun , but he sent a letter to Nariaki that ' I do not want to take the whole country , but I have not been able to take the whole country . '

There is also a theory that it was the Japanese mythology that spread to Japan along with the <unk> of the world , because it was a <unk> <unk> that was considered to be the sun of the sun .
According to " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the god changed to the third stage .
It is described as follows :
645 : The Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family does not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this .
" <unk> " ( the god of the sun ) , " the sun of the sun . "
The male god called ' <unk> ' was widely enshrined .
In " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there is a shrine named ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> Shrine ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> Shrine ) , ' <unk> Shrine ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .

672 : Jinshin War
" <unk> " ( <unk> ) is a daughter of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and ' <unk> ' ( a woman of the sun god ) .
In this case , it is interpreted as the interpretation that the enshrined deity is <unk> , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> , ' a male god of <unk> .
The shrine was founded by the Imperial Family at that time .
" Amaterasu , " ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family , ' ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created as a model for the god of the god , and was created by the god of the god .
After that , ' Amaterasu ' was called ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
For example , in " Sarashina Nikki " ( the Sarashina Diary ) , the part of ' Amaterasu Omikami ' ( the Sun Goddess ) was read as ' <unk> , ' and ' <unk> ' was pronounced ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' in " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) .
In 1880 , the religious debate occurred in the Shinto religion of Shinto in the Shinto religion of the Shinto religion , which was established in Tokyo in 1881 .
The Bureau of Shinto was enshrined as the enshrined deity in the shrine 's shrine , and the four gods of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) and Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) were enshrined , but the ' Izumo school ' insisted that the ' Izumo school ' should be divided into five pillars , including the ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) , ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) , and ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) should be divided into five pillars .
However , the ' Ise school , ' which was the center of the Shinto Shinto office , was the ' <unk> ' ( the world of heaven and earth ) , which was the center of the <unk> ( the Great Council of State ) , and the two other gods insisted that the two gods were not just a subject of each other , and the two other gods insisted that the two other gods were not just a subject .
In the past , there were various stories such as ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '
Before long , this dispute was decided by the Emperor Meiji , and the god of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was positioned as the highest rank .
In addition , it is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the basic system in Shinto , and it is said that the modern state was impossible to control the common people directly directly by the Shinto religion of Shinto .
Refer to the article of the <unk> Shrine of Shinto Shinto .
Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA used the name ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) in his own novel , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
This was because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was written as ' <unk> ' ( the god of the sun ) , so it was not necessary to make the sun god , and it was not necessary to use ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
In fact , there are many places where the troops were forced to be forced to be forced by the army of the army , and there were many places where they were forced to be forced to be forced to be forced .
