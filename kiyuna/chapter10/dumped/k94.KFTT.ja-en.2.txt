History
He was born to the birth of Empress Suiko .
July 12 , 645 - Crown Prince
August 24 , 1304 -
February 20 , 668 - ascended the throne .
January 7 , 672 - 46 years old
( In " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he died from illness , and it was said that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and the theory was that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , and the assassination of Emperor Tenmu is said to have been killed .
It was a political history in the middle of the seventh century , because Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne .
There are several theories about this .
It is an consideration for the power of the Emperor Tenmu to support Emperor Tenmu .
In other words , the theory that the Emperor Tenmu was the younger brother of Emperor Tenmu , was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , but it is wrong to say that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei and was a maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi .
According to the history of the Emperor Tenmu , the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenmu , which was written in the history of the history of the Emperor Tenchi , and the Emperor Tenmu died .
However , there are many historical materials about the age of nine to nine years old , and there are many historical materials that have a difference between eight to nine years .
On the other hand , there is a theory that ' his father was different from his older brother , but his younger brother was the younger brother , ' but it is said that he died in the age of age of age , but he died in the age of age of age , and when he was 16 years old , he passed away when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the birth year of the birth of the real year was that year , which was adopted by the Imperial family of the Imperial family , was adopted .
According to " ancient times , " there is a theory that he was not rare in the ancient times , and he was not able to ascend the throne , and he was not enthroned after the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito .
Therefore , it was said that the relationship was born .
According to the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , there is a theory that the same thing is different from the period when it was compiled , and there is a theory that it was not the same as that of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) .
( Refer to the section of ' Emperor Tenmu 's age ' )
It is said that the Incident of the Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat by Prince Oama ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Naka no Oe no Oji was expelled from the position .
It is pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was relatively good and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar to the basic policy .
The reason why Prince Naka no Oe killed Iruka .
In addition , in the article of the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki , the theory was accepted by the fact that it was approved .
In addition , there is a doubt that the Soga clan , who was not expelled by the Soga clan , was expelled from the coup by the Retired Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication of the throne , and the reason why the Soga clan was not exiled .

interpretation
In the mythology , there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami was born in the same way as he was born , and the scene where Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was to be described , is also seen in the scene where Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is a god of religious services ( festival ) , and is considered to be the god of the emperor who ruled the country .
Also , there is a view that it is a god of ancient shrine maiden .
The other name ' <unk> ' is the name of a shrine maiden who served the sun god .
There is a theory that the sun god was originally a male god , but there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served as a god became the same as the sun god .
Also , there is a theory that it was the time when Himiko was established , and it is said that the god was the Empress Jito , which was the model of the Empress Jito , and it is said that Himiko was the model of Amaterasu Omikami .
The birth of the god of the sun , Amaterasu Omikami , and Tsukuyomi no kami ( the god of the moon ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and ' <unk> <unk> ' ( <unk> ) ( the beginning of the sixth century ) are pointed out , and it has been pointed out that the influence of Taoism has been pointed out .
Also , the god of Ise Jingu Shrine , which enshrines Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) , is the same term as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
It is pointed out that the myth of Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) is almost equal to the myth that Amaterasu Omikami ( the Sun Goddess ) was born in the ancient times ( 3 - fourth century ) .
There is also a theory that it was a Japanese myth that spread in Asia with the <unk> of the Japanese people in the past , because it was a pure <unk> , which is considered to be the sun .
According to " Nihonshoki , " there is a theory that the god changed to the third stage .
The following are the following reasons :
645 : The Taika Reforms
The Imperial Family does not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami before this .
" <unk> " is the name of the sun .
The male god called ' <unk> ' was widely enshrined .
In the " Engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , there are shrines that have the name of ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) such as ' <unk> Shrine , ' ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> . '
Incidentally , the name of the male god is the name of Amaterasu 's grandchild , and is also the name of the Owari clan , the Owari clan , and the founder of the clan .
He was also the younger brother of Ninigi , and he was the grandfather of Emperor Jinmu .
672 : Jinshin War
" <unk> " ( <unk> ) , " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , and " <unk> " ( <unk> ) .
In this case , it is interpreted that the enshrined deity is <unk> ( <unk> ) , and it is interpreted as ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) of <unk> .
It was founded by the Imperial Family in place of the Imperial Family .
" Amaterasu , " ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family , ' ' the ancestor of the Imperial Family . '
She is a goddess .
It was created as a model for the god of the god , and was created by the god of the god .
After that , ' Amaterasu ' was called ' <unk> ' ( literally , " great god " ) from the Imperial family .
For example , " Sarashina Nikki " ( The Sarashina Diary ) is written as ' <unk> ' ( literally , " the god of Amaterasu Omikami " ) , and the part of ' Amaterasu ' is read as ' <unk> , ' and ' <unk> ' in the " Sendai Kujihongi " ( Ancient Japanese History ) is also read as ' <unk> . '
In 1880 , the religious debate occurred in the Shinto religion of Shinto in the Shinto religion of the Shinto religion , which was established in Tokyo in 1881 .
The Bureau of Shinto was enshrined as the enshrined deity in the shrine 's shrine , and the four deities of the gods were enshrined in the three deities of the four gods , such as ' <unk> , ' ' <unk> , ' and ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) , and the ' <unk> ' insisted that the ' <unk> ' should be added to the five pillars , including the ' <unk> ' ( the world of the world ) .
However , the ' Ise school ' who played the central role of Shinto rituals was the ' <unk> ' ( the world of heaven and earth ) , which was the ' <unk> ' ( the Great Council of heaven and earth ) , which was the center of the <unk> ( the Great Council of State ) , and the other gods insisted that the two gods were not just a subject of their vassals .
In the past , there were various stories such as ' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . '
Before long , this dispute was decided by the Emperor Meiji , and the god of Amaterasu Omikami was positioned as the highest rank .
It is said that the government recognized that the government was able to control the public directly by the establishment of the doctrine of the basic system in Shinto , and it is said that the modern state was impossible to control the common people directly directly by the Shinto religion .
Refer to the article of the <unk> Shrine of Shinto Shinto .
When Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA appears in novels , he used the name ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) .
This was because the name ' Amaterasu Omikami ' was written as ' <unk> , ' because the name of the sun god was written as ' Amaterasu Omikami , ' because it was not used as the god of the sun , the sun god was not used .
In fact , there are many places where the troops were forced to be forced to be forced by the army of the army of the army , and there were many places where they were forced to be forced to be forced .
<unk> ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) was established in 1926 ( <unk> ) , and in 1926 , the belief of Amaterasu Omikami is the faith of Amaterasu Omikami .
Amaterasu Omikami is an ideal ideal that the world of the world is to make the world .
