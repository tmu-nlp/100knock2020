Brief Personal History
626 :
July 12 , 645 : He became Crown Prince .
August 24 , 661 :
February 20 , 668 :
December 7 , 672 : 46 years old .
( According to " Fuso Ryakki " ( A Brief History of Japan ) , it is said that the Emperor Tenmu 's assassination of the Emperor Tenmu was killed by the Emperor Tenmu , saying , ' The Emperor is the mountain of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain in the mountains of the mountain , ' and it is said that he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu .
It is a mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious mysterious history in the middle of the seventh century .
There are several theories about this .
It is a feelings that the Emperor Tenmu recommended Emperor Tenmu .
It is a misunderstanding that the Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , who was the younger brother of Emperor Tenchi , and it is based on the theory that Emperor Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei .
When the Emperor Tenmu died at the age of Emperor Tenchi in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , he was born at the age of Emperor Tenmu .
However , there is no contradiction between the two historical materials , but there are many historical materials that have a difference between 8 and 9 .
On the other hand , there was a theory that ' the father of his father , who had a younger brother , was said to be a younger brother , ' but it is said that the age of the age of 16 , which is described in " Nihon Shoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was the age of 16 , which was the age of 16 , which was the age of 16 , which was the age of 16 , which was the age of 16 , when Emperor Jomei ascended the throne .
Therefore , the year of this year was in 614 , the year of the same year , and in 614 , the year of birth was adopted .
" In the ancient times , " in " ancient times , it was not unusual in the ancient times , " and it was not unusual for the Emperor Tenchi and Jito ( Empress Jito , who had already been enthroned in the era of Emperor Tenmu , and the Emperor was not enthroned . )
It was a misunderstanding that it was a mistake .
There is also an opinion that the book is different from the fact that " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , which is said to be the same as the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , was compiled .
( Refer to the article of ' Emperor Tenmu age ' )
It is said that the Isshi Incident was a coup d 'etat of Prince Karu ( Emperor Kotoku ) , and Prince Naka no Oe was dismissed from the position .
In recent years , the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oe and SOGA no Iruka was very good , and the basic policy was similar to the basic policy .
Then , Naka no Oe no Oe no Oji killed Iruka .
In addition , in the description of the Taika Reforms of Nihonshoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) , this theory came to be accepted by this theory .
In this theory , the reason why the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication was banned by the Soga clan , who had not been expelled after the Emperor Kogyoku 's abdication , and so on .
It is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was acceded to the throne .
This is because Emperor Kotoku , who was described in " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , had a relationship with Emperor Tenchi and Emperor Tenchi , who had a relationship with Emperor Tenchi .
